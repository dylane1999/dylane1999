### Hey there, I'm Dylan.ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Junior Computer Science major at Occidental College, and a software engineering intern at Experian. Most of my projects are written in Javascript, Python, Java, or C. I love Developing Fullstack Projects!    
    
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about event driven architecture with Kafka, state management tools (Redux, Saga, Flux), typescript, and Building REST APIs with Spring.   
ðŸ’¬ Ask me about how I got into full stack development, or what I plan to work on next.
