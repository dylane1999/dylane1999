### Hey there!, I'm Dylan.👋

I'm a Junior Computer Science major at Occidental College, and an incoming software engineering intern at Experian. Most of my projects are written in Javascript, Python, or C. I love Developing Fullstack Projects, using React and Express!    
    
🌱 I’m currently learning about state management tools (Redux, Saga, Flux), and experimenting with AWS and Google Cloud (RDS, Firebase cloud functions, ec2, and more).     
💬 Ask me about how I got into web development, or what I plan to work on next.
